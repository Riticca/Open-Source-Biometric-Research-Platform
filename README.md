# Open Source Biometric Research Platform

Open Source Biometric Research Platform (OSBP) is a desktop-based application that is used primarily by the researchers for
visualization of different biometric signals/parameters for a given user. It acts like a platform that is helpful for researchers to visualize & study biometric signals such as Eye Tracking, Galvanic Skin Response, EEG, EMG, ECG. The biometric signals are synchronized with the video and screen recording section of the application.
